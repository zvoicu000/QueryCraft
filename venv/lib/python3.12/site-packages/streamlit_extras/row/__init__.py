    Insert a multi-element, horizontal container into your app.

    This function inserts a container into your app that can hold
    a number of elements as defined in the provided spec. Elements can be added
    to the returned container by calling methods directly on the returned object.

    Args:
        spec (SpecType): Controls the number and width of cells to insert in the row. Can be one of:
            * An integer specifying the number of cells. All cells will have equal
            width in this case.
            * An iterable of numbers (int or float) that specifies the relative width of
            each cell. For instance, ``[0.7, 0.3]`` creates two cells where the first
            one occupies 70% of the available width, and the second one occupies 30%.
            Or, ``[1, 2, 3]`` creates three cells where the second one is twice
            as wide as the first one, and the third one is three times that width.
        gap (Optional[str], optional): "small", "medium", or "large"
            The size of the gap between cells, can be "small", "medium", or "large".
            This parameter specifies the visual space between the elements within the row.
            Defaults to "small".
        vertical_align (Literal["top", "center", "bottom"], optional): The vertical alignment
            of the cells in the row. It can be either "top", "center", or "bottom", aligning
            the contents of each cell accordingly. Defaults to "top".

    Returns:
        grid.GridDeltaGenerator: RowContainer
            A row container object. Elements can be added to this row by calling methods directly
            on the returned object.
